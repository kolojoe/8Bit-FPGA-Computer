# 8Bit-FPGA-Computer
The 8Bit Computer by Ben Eater built on an FPGA

This project primarily contains the HDL that mimics Ben Eater's 8-bit computer that he built over a series of
YouTube videos. This project should also seek to contain some instructions/information on how one can 
do various FPGA specific things like choose pin assignments, constraints, floor planning, etc.
